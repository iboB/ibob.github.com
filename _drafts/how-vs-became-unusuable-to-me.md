One of the few products that still keep me mostly Windows is Visual Studio. I think I can safely say that for the past 25 years, it has been the best IDE for C++ programming[^1]. I think the modern contenders for this title would be CLion and Visual Studio Code. I don't have much experience with CLion, but I've been reading good things about it. Whenever *I'm* not on Windows, I use VSCode. Previously I used QtCreator. Before that I used Code::Blocks and before that, 3000 years ago, mostly nano or SciTe[^2].

Ever since Visual Studio had CMake support with "Open Folder" I've been using this workflow exclusevly and I have absolutely no desire to go back to manually generated .sln/.vcxproj files. That's mostly because I would have to ditch ninja, but there are many reasons as well. Custom configurations
