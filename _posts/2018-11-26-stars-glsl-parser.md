## Review

This library parses GLSL to an AST. This can have many uses if you're building your own engine or some kind of graphics-related tool. The most common application of something like this is to extract metadata from a shader in order to add it to a material system appropriately. A less common but much more powerful application would be to extend the GLSL language itself. 

Again a straightforward library which does one thing and it does it well.
