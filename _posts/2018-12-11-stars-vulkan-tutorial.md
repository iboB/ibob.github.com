## Review

This, as other book repos, doesn't seem particularly useful with its repo status. At least not to me. It's not a repository one would use in a project of theirs.

...But it seems like a pretty good book. It's an introduction to Vulkan for C++ programmers, or at least people with C++ experience. I haven't yet had the chance to familiarize myself with Vulkan, but when I find the time (and I do intend to find the time), I will most likely start from here. Well, from the website of the book, that is.

Do you know of better starting points? If yes, please share.
