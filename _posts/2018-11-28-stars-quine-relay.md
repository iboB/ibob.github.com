excerpt: An uroboros program with 100+ programming languages

There are many repos on GitHub which are only there for entertainment: [serious projects in esoteric languages](https://github.com/LoganKelly/LOLTracer), [overly-complicated code](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition), [simple jokes](https://github.com/qw3rtman/git-fire), and even [political satire in the form of software](https://github.com/samshadwell/TrumpScript). Frankly, I'm sometimes amazed how much time and effort people are willing to invest in something like this. But, then again, I myself have invested a lot of time being entertained by such projects. It's art.

## Review

So, a quine is a program which outputs it's own source code. This is easy in the [Hello programming language](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Hello), but not that easy in others. It's actually a fun exercise to try to do it.

Uroboros[^1], or ouroboros[^2], or uroborus[^3] (not sure there's a consensus on how this is spelled) is the [fitting name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) for a program which outputs the source code of a another program, which output the source of another... and so on, until the circle is closed by the last program outputting the source code of the first.

Quine Relay is an uroboros with 128 steps in 128 different languages. Er... well, I'm out of words, so I'll end on this.
