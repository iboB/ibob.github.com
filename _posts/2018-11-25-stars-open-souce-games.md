I'm sure you're familiar with GitHub's **Awesome** lists. There's even an [awesome list of **Awesome** lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). Today's star is an awesome list which is not an **Awesome** list.

## Review

With this one I'm breaking the rule of posting about stars in the order in which I gave them. It's not an old star of mine. It's actually my newest one. I thought it's a pretty cool list and decided to share it and give it some publicity. I think it deserves it.

This is a list of open source games. There already is [an **Awesome** list of open source games](https://github.com/leereilly/games) out there, but it lists only games (and other things) on GitHub and it's simply a list of links. The list in the repo I'm posting about today is much more. It has over 400 entries of open source games, and not all of them are on GitHub. For each title it also provides some meta information, much like I do for the stars posts on my blog, but unlike my posts it's actually searchable and sortable through the website. The meta information includes project state (active or inactive), keywords, license, and language.

Whether you want to play or learn from existing sources, it's definitely worth checking out!
