## Review

There have been many attempts to create a library which lets users create mobile applications for both Android and iOS from a single codebase. Probably the most successful (and sensible) one is [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and it's not [without](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) [its](https://www.intertech.com/Blog/react-native-pros-cons-building-mobile-apps-just-got-simpler/) [criticism](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/the-good-and-the-bad-of-reactjs-and-react-native/). Because of this many developers still choose to just go and work on two codebases: one in Java or another jvm language for Android and one in Objective-C or Swift for iOS. The only ones who can afford to go the single codebase route are game developers. They don't care for the native look and use their own GUI systems.

**boden** seems like the answer to this problem. Now, I haven't tested this library, and it's in a too early stage of development to be practically useful, but from browsing the source and docs for a while, I think it could become the solution mobile developers have been looking for (or even the one they didn't know they needed). It looks like a very serious effort in the right direction. I am keeping my eye on this one and if you're a mobile developer, you should too.

I can only wish the authors good luck!
