excerpt: A tiny JSON library for C++11.

The main qualities of a library don't need to be the amount of features or the stellar performance. I mean, those are great qualities, but sometimes I don't care that much about them, and instead want something which is easy to use and integrate.

## Review

json11 is a small library for serialization and deserializaton to JSON written in pure C++11. It's not the fastest out there and it's not the most feature-rich one either. However, it has a nice and readable syntax. Using it can make C++ JSON serialization feel like JavaScript.

It's pretty easy to integrate too. It has a `Makefile` and `CMakeLists.txt` but you can copy just the single header and single cpp file in your project and it works just as well. I've used it on a couple of occasions where all I wanted was JSON and I didn't care that much about performance. It's what it's for.
