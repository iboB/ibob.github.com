excerpt: Introducing rants
---

During my many years developing C++ software I have encountered many issues which range from mildly annoying to infuriating. I have previously posted about some of them. In fact I'd say that most of my posts here have been about such things.

I have prioritized these which I deemed more useful to the community and have been witholding ones that I can do nothing about, or, rather, ones which would require too much of investment to address, much in the spirit of [this famous tweet](https://twitter.com/swaglord__420/status/1377051721655066629).

I have decided to write posts about the rest as well. Perhaps others will get as mad as I am about them, or more, and they will do what I wouldn't. Perhaps, even though I don't find them educational, others will.

It's mostly just venting, though.

So I'll create a tag [*rants*](/blog/tags/#rants) and post some stuff under it.

And if anyone in power to do something about any of them reads,

... please.
