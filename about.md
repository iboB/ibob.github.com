Hello. I'm Borislav Stanimirov and I'm a programmer from Bulgaria.

This is a website and blog which I'll use to collect my existing writings and share interesting new things that I learn.

I'm mainly a C++ programmer but I enjoy learning new langauges. I have written a lot of Ruby and I like playing with Nim, D, lua, MoonScript, TypeScript, Haskell, Lisp, Mathematica, and many more. Some programming languages I just dislike. These include Java, perl, PHP, Pascal, and Basic.

Most of my professional career has been in game development and most of *that* in startups. Sadly none of them were succcessful.

I started working as a programmer professionally at 18 in 2002, right after high-school. In 2006 I joined a newly formed startup to work on a MMORPG and that's how my career in gamedev started. In 2012 I started working primarily on mobile games. In late 2018, after working for a total of five failed startups and two regular game development companies, I left the game industry. I'm now working on medical software. Curiously enough, it's not *that* different from game development.

I still enjoy playing games. And not just video games. There are many card, board and party games that I like, bridge taking lead there. I've been playing bridge recreationally since 1999.

Some other preferences and opinions I have:

* **OS:** I use Windows and Linux (I use Arch, btw) equally. I'm not a big fan of Apple, but I am eyeing Asahi Linux, and it may yet convert me to a MacBook at least.
* **Editor/IDE:** I prefer Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and SciTE. I've never did become a fan of vim. In vim I can do basic editing, but it's not my editor of choice. For more serous text editing in a terminal-only enviroment I use micro.
* **Version Control:** I prefer git or Mercurial. I've grown to dislike SVN, CVS, and anything not distributed. On a side note, I prefer Mercurial to git, but it has become so niche that I haven't actually used hg for years.
* **C++ standard:** Modern. I write mostly in C++17 in order to support toolchains that are a bit behind, but I use C++20 when I can.
* **C++ build toolset:** I've been using CMake occasionally since 2010 and exclusively since 2012. I used to like premake, but due to lack of features, I completely abandoned it 2012.
* **Open-source licenses:** I mostly use MIT and CC-By. I'm not a fan of copyleft licenses and I try to avoid them.
* **Bridge bidding system:** I play a modified version of Modern Acol with my regular partner. When paired with other people I usually use SAYC or Precision. I like Blue Club, but there are very few people that still play it. I find fourth major openers particularly appealing.
* **Video Games:** Some of my favorites are BroodWar, TitanQuest, TLJ, NWN, Baldur's Gate, and Pillars of Eternity.
* **Non-video Games:** Besides bridge, I enjoy pen and paper RPGs, The Resistance, charades, and many more.
* **Fiction:** I prefer sci-fi, but there are many other genres that I like. The Hyperion Cantos and the works of Stanislaw Lem are to list some of my all-time favourites.
